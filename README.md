![build](https://github.com/jhandfield/ChooseForMe/actions/workflows/testbuild.yaml/badge.svg)

A simple .NET console app that helps you choose between a list of options; simply feed in the number of options to choose from, and how many votes a single option needs to be declared the winner, then kick back and let the app do the rest. Great for those of us who are perpetually indecisive and will end up doing nothing if someone else doesn't make a decision for us!

# Usage
`dotnet run <number of options> <votes needed>`

This app only accepts inputs from the command-line, no interactive inputs.
